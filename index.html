            <p>
                Ever since I was a kid I always went to video games to lose myself and escape from the real world. It gave me a sanctuary to be myself and explore who I could be. Whether I had friends to play with or not, I was almost exclusivly either playing games,
                or watching videos about them. For as long as I can remember whenever I thought about what I wanted to do, I never thought twice about becoming a Game Designer/Developer.
                <br><br> Fortunatly for me, my high school had some Game Design and Development classes that I took as soon as posible. There I found a new type of enjoyment when it comes to video games, making them. I learned how to make simple games
                using Game Maker, starting off with drag and drop and moving on to GML (Game Maker Language). While it isn't a popular language, it gave me an idea of what coding would be like.
                <br><br> Unfortunatly my school only offered two levels of GDD classes. I tried to get a GDD independent study but it didn't work out. Alternatly, I took an independent study of Web Development (after taking Web Dev 1) and helped work
                on my schools website.
                <br><br> Now, I am curently a forth year student at Rochester Institute of Technology and am taking part in its Game Design and Development major. I have a particular passion for game design, but also enjoy coding. I have had the 
                ability to work on multiple games as a game designer from physical to digital, and it's made it clear I'm in the right place.
